```

### Code Quality Standards

#### Java Code Standards

```java
// Use modern Java features
public record UserCreateRequest(@NotBlank @Size(max = 100) String username, @Email String email, @Valid AddressDto address) {}

// Prefer immutable objects
@Value
@Builder
public class User {

  String id;
  String username;
  String email;
  Instant createdAt;
  List<String> roles;
}

// Use descriptive method names
public Optional<User> findActiveUserByEmail(String email) {
  return userRepository.findByEmailAndActiveTrue(email);
}

// Document complex business logic
/**
 * Calculates user subscription cost based on plan and usage.
 *
 * @param user the user requesting calculation
 * @param plan the subscription plan
 * @param usageMetrics current usage data
 * @return calculated cost with tax included
 * @throws InvalidPlanException if plan is not valid for user
 */
public Money calculateSubscriptionCost(User user, Plan plan, UsageMetrics usageMetrics) {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Testing Standards

```java
// Unit Tests - AAA Pattern
@Test
@DisplayName("Should calculate subscription cost for premium plan")
void shouldCalculateSubscriptionCostForPremiumPlan() {
  // Arrange
  var user = createTestUser();
  var plan = Plan.PREMIUM;
  var usageMetrics = UsageMetrics.builder().apiCalls(1000).storageGB(50).build();

  // Act
  var cost = subscriptionService.calculateSubscriptionCost(user, plan, usageMetrics);

  // Assert
  assertThat(cost.getAmount()).isEqualByComparingTo("99.99");
  assertThat(cost.getCurrency()).isEqualTo("USD");
}

// Integration Tests with Testcontainers
@SpringBootTest
@Testcontainers
class UserServiceIntegrationTest {

  @Container
  static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15");

  @Test
  void shouldCreateUserWithValidData() {
    // Test implementation
  }
}

// Architecture Tests
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "com.iqkv")
class ArchitectureTest {

  @ArchTest
  static final ArchRule servicesOnlyAccessedByControllers = classes().that().resideInAPackage("..service..").should().onlyBeAccessed().byAnyPackage("..controller..", "..service..");
}
```
