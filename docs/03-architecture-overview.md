# Architecture Overview

## Application Structure

This Spring Boot template follows a standard layered architecture:

```
src/main/java/
├── config/           # Configuration classes
├── controller/       # REST controllers
├── model/            # Domain models and entities
├── repository/       # Data access layer
├── service/          # Business logic
└── Application.java  # Main application class
```

## Key Components

- **Spring Boot**: Application framework providing auto-configuration
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
2. **Convention over Configuration**: Spring Boot defaults
3. **Testability**: Components designed for easy testing
4. **Modularity**: Well-defined interfaces between components

## Configuration Management

- **application.properties/yml**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Maven profiles**: Build-time configuration
- **Docker Compose**: Development environment setup

## Security Considerations

- Secure coding practices enforced by Checkstyle rules
- HTTPS configuration templates
- Authentication and authorization templates

## Extensibility

The template is designed to be extended with:

- Additional Spring Boot starters
- Custom configurations
- Integration with external services

## Recommended Practices

- Follow the package structure for new components
- Maintain separation between layers
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Write tests for all components
