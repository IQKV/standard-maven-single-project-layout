# Project Overview

## Introduction

This Spring Boot template provides a standardized foundation for developing Java applications using Spring Boot. It follows Maven's standard single-project layout and includes a comprehensive set of tools and configurations to streamline development.

## Key Features

- **Standard Maven Structure**: Follows the conventional Maven project layout
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Pre-configured for Spring Boot application development
- **Quality Assurance**: Integrated code quality tools (Checkstyle, JaCoCo)
- **Development Workflow**: Git hooks, conventional commits, and automated workflows
- **Documentation**: documentation and community guidelines
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration testing setup with testcontainers support
- **Docker Support**: Containerization with Docker and Docker Compose
